- **Mutual Funds & Bonds:** Support for investing in mutual funds and bonds.
- **User Portfolio:** Displays all user transactions, including purchases and net gain calculations.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication using Firebase.
- **Database & Transactions:** Firestore database is used to store transaction history and user-related data.

## Technologies Used
- **React (TypeScript Template)**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
